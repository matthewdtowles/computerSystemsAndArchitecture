Cache and Memory Mapping

Part I

Consider a computer that you have used or now use. (You may make an assumption on word size if needed.)

How large is the memory of the computer?
	16 GiB = 2^34
How long is a word in the computer above?
	64 bits
How many bits are required to address the bytes in that memory?
	34 bits
How many data lines are required to read data from the computer memory?
	64

Part II

Does your computer have cache?
	Yes
If so how big is it?
	L2: 1 MiB
	L3: 8 MiB 
How does your cache size compare with the size of main memory?
	(2^34) / ((2^23) + (2^20)) is roughly 1820
	Main memory is roughly 1820 times the size of the L2 and L3 cache combined.
Do you know what kind of cache it is?
	L2 and L3
How did you find out about your computer's cache?
	`wmic cpu get L2CacheSize, L3CacheSize` in windows 10 command prompt
	Running command for L1CacheSize gave an error for an invalid query.
Make an assumption that your cache is:
	Two-way set-associative

Determine the size of Tag, Set, and Word for 2-Way Set-Associative Cache.
	Assuming 4 words per block
	Address = 34 bits
	(2^34) / (2^2) = 2^32 blocks 
	L2 Cache = 2^20 bits 
	(2^20) / (2^2) = 2^18 blocks / 2 = 2^17 sets in L2 Cache 
	L3 Cache = 2^23 bits 
	(2^23) / (2^2) = 2^21 blocks / 2 = 2^20 sets in L3 Cache 
	2^21 > (2^20 + 2^17)
	So 21 bits for set 
	SET = 21 bits 
	
	Since there are 4 (2^2) words per block, 2 bits for Word
	WORD = 2 bits
	2 Blocks per set (2^1 = 2), 1 bit for set
	
	Tag = 34 - 21 - 2 = 11
	
	TAG = 11 | SET = 21 | WORD = 2

Part III

Given the following:

Logical Memory size of 1000
Physical Memory size of 2000
Page (and frame) size of 100
Block A contains data for a program
Select Block Aâ€™s size and its starting point in both memories. Then write the page table for Block A based on your selections.  

See below for the layout of both memories and an example of Block A of size 200.
