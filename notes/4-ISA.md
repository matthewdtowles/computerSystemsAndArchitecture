# IV: Instruction Set Architecture

## i. Instruction Formats

### i-1 Design Decisions for ISAs
- ISAs are measured by:
    - Amount of space a program requires
    - Complexity of instruction set
        - i.e: the amount of decoding needed to execute an instruction
    - Length of instruction
    - Total number of instructions
- Fixed length instructions easier to decode
    - Could waste space
    - Does not imply fixed number of operands
- If mem has multi-byte words then a single character can only be reached if mem is byte-addressable


### i-2 Little vs. Big Endian
- Endian meaning "byte order"
- Storing from LSB to MSB or MSB to LSB
- **Little Endian**: byte at lower address has lower significance
    - Most PCs
    - Example storing 4-byte integer:
        - ```
            Base address + 0 = Byte0
            Base address + 1 = Byte1
            Base address + 2 = Byte2
            Base address + 3 = Byte3
            ```
- **Big Endian**: MSB first followed by LSB. MSB at lower address.
    - Most UNIX machines and newer RISCs
    - Example storing 4-byte integer:
        - ```
            Base address + 0 = Byte3
            Base address + 1 = Byte2
            Base address + 2 = Byte1
            Base address + 3 = Byte0
            ```
- Example problem:
    - Byte-addressable machine
    - 0x12345678 (32-bits) stored at 0
        - Each digit requires 4 bits = 1/2 byte => 2 digits/byte
    - ```
        Address       | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11 |
        -----------------------------------
        Big Endian    | 12 | 34 | 56 | 78 |
        Little Endian | 78 | 56 | 34 | 12 |
        ```
- Big endian reads more naturally
- Must be accounted for as big endian software must have byte order reversed to work on little endian machine and vice versa
- Big endian conversion to little takes longer as addition is required


### i-3 Stacks vs. Registers (Internal Storage on CPU)
- 3 ways a CPU could store data (could be designed 1/3 ways):
    1. Stack architecture
        - Operands found on top of stack
        - Cannot be accessed randomly
            - Difficult to generate efficient code
    2. Accumulator architecture
        - One operand in accumulator
        - Minimize complexity of machine with short instructions
        - High memory traffic
            - Due to accumulator only being temp
    3. General purpose register (GPR) architecture
        - Most widely accepted today
        - Register sets are faster than memory
        - Easy for compilers to deal with
        - Large number of registers may be used at low cost
        - Longer instructions (all operands must be named) => longer fetch/decode time
            - _Short instruction times are the holy grail of ISA designers_
- If memory is fast => stack is good
- If memory is slow => GPRs are best
- Main differences between GPRs:
    - Number of operands
    - How operands are addressed

#### General Purpose Architecture Classifications (3)
1. **Memory-memory**
    - May have 2 or 3 operands in memory
        - Allows instruction to perform an operation without operand in register
2. **Register-memory**
    - One operand in register and one in memory
3. **Load-store**
    - data must be in registers before any operations on data


### i-4 Number of Operands and Instruction Length
- Instructions can be formatted in fixed length or variable length
- Instructions must be word-aligned for addressing
    - Instructions 1/2 word size waste 1/2 word of space
    - _Variable length instructions still need to be word aligned_
- Common instruction formats have 0 - 3 operands
- Most arithmetic ops have 2 operands
    - Did it with 1 in MARIE - accumulator was implicit
- Third operand could be for destination of results
- Common instruction formats:
    - `OPCODE`
    - `OPCODE + Address` (usually memory address)
    - `OPCODE + Address1 + Address2` (registers or register+memory)
    - `OPCODE + Address1 + Address2 + Address3` (registers or reg+mem combos)
- Stack allows for 0 operands
- `Add` instruction in stack architecture (commutative):
    1. pop the top two operands
    2. push sum onto stack
- `Subtract` instruction in stack architecture (non-commutative):
    - top stack subtracted FROM next top of stack
    1. a = pop(); b = pop();
    2. push(b-a)
- **Infix**:  `x + y`
    - `(x + y) * (w - z) + 2`
- **Prefix**:  `+ x y`
- **Postfix**:  `x y +`
    - `x y + w z - * 2 +`
    - _Walk through postfix problem_:
        - `sumxy diffwz * 2 +`
        - `prodSumxyDiffwz 2 +`
        - `sumOfProdSumxyDiffwzAndTwo`

#### Example:  z = (x + y) + (w * u)
- 3 operands:
    - first operand usually is register (could be destination or source)
    - (destination in following example)
    - ```
        Mult    R1, x, y
        Mult    R2, w, u
        Add     z, R2, R1
        ```
- 2 operands:
    - at least one operand is a register
    - first operand is destination in this example
    - ```
        Load    R1, x
        Mult    R1, y
        Load    R2, w
        Mult    R2, u
        Add     R1, R2
        Store   z, R1
        ```
- 1 operand:
    - must assume a register (like accumulator) is implied as destination
    - ```
        Load    x
        Mult    y
        Store   temp
        Load    w
        Mult    u
        Add     temp
        Store   z
        ```
- O address instructions (stack):
    - has only push/pop operations
    - ```
        Push    x
        Push    y
        Mult
        Push    w
        Push    u
        Mult    
        Add
        Store   z
        ```


## ii. Instruction Types

#### Data Movement
- Most common instruction type
- Data from mem->reg, reg->reg, reg->mem

#### Arithmetic
- Instructions that use ints and floats

#### Boolean
- Instruction for performing AND, NOT, OR, XOR ops

#### Bit manipulation (shift and rotate)
- Used to set/reset individual bits in a word
- Shift and rotate instructions

#### I/O
- Basic schemes for handling I/O:
    - programmed I/O
    - interrupt-driven I/O
    - DMA devices

#### Transfer of control
- Branches
    - unconditional or conditional
- Skips
    - branch instruction with implied addresses
- Procedure calls
    - Special branch instruction that saves the return address

#### Special purpose
- String processing
- High-level language support
- Protection, flag control
- Cache management


## iii. Addressing

### iii-1 Data Types
- Must be hardware support for a data type if instruction references it
- Numeric types: integers, floating points
    - And their subsequent types (signed vs unsigned; size)
- Nonnumeric types:
    - Strings
        - Copy, move, search, modify
    - Booleans
        - AND, OR, XOR, NOT
    - Pointers (addresses in memory)
        - Treated differently than numeric types

### iii-2 Address Modes
- Addressing modes allow for operand bits to represent different things
    - i.e.: operand bits could be a pointer to could be the memory address among other things
        - could also be a constant, register, etc...

#### Immediate Addressing
- Value to be referenced follows the opcode in instruction
- Value is actual value -- not an address
- E.g.: `Load 008` = numeric value 8 is loaded into the AC
- Fast but inflexible

#### Direct Addressing
- Memory address is part of instruction
- E.g.: `Load 008` means the value at mem location 008 is loaded into AC
- Fast, flexible

#### Register Addressing
- Like direct addressing, but with register instead of memory

#### Indirect Addressing
- Bits in address field specify memory address that is to be used as a pointer
- E.g.: `Load 008` means data at address 008 is the actual address of desired operand
- Provides exceptional flexibility

#### Indexed and Based Addressing
- 

#### Stack Addressing

#### Other Addressing Modes
